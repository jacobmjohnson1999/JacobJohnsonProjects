This assembler is created to make the testing of the design created for the MIPS processor faster. This converts MIPS assembly into machine code. This machine code is used to program the instruction memory for the attached processor design.

To use, put your equivalent assembly in the ReadCode.txt file. The Assembly.mif file is the output of the code after the python script as been run.
