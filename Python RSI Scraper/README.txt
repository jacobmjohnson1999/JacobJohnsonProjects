This project is intended to scrape Yahoo Finance and calculate the RSI values on a set of stocks provided. These stocks can be changed with the CSV file "stockWatchList.csv" putting one stock per row.

Currently, the project will correctly get the information from Yahoo Finance and correctly calculates the RSI. This information is displayed to the user as well as the lowest RSI. 

Future plans for this project include an automatic buy and sell function where the system can automate the buying and selling of stocks on my behalf.
