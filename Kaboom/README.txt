This project was intended to recreate the old arcade game "Kaboom" in VHDL using a DE10 Lite FPGA. 

This project was assigned as part of ECE 4110 Digital System Design at Tennessee Technological University. The professor is Dr. J.W. Bruce.

To run, the project needs to be compiled in quartus prime lite, then programmed to the appropriate board. To run it, plug in a VGA cable ot the socket on the FPGA and conenct the rotary encoder for control (no documentation was given).

This project was completed with Jacob Wheeling.
